    <summary><h3>About Me</h3></summary>
    I got my first taste of programming in middle school where I created batch files on my mom's work computer when she would step out of her office.
    That initial interest only strengthened when my school began implementing "one hour of code" which was an event where one day out of the year,
    the school would allocate an hour to teach students how to code using block programming. Eventually, I enrolled in an Early College High School.
    Which allowed me to pursue an associate degree in computer science concurrent to the completion of my High School Diploma. It was here that I
    met a professor who was monumental to my programming journey. Under this professor I learned many of the skills I have today. Including C++, Java,
    C, algorithms, and even Assembly Language. He opened my eyes to the world of Computer Science and helped me to realize the impact it has on the world.
    Moreover, an alumnus from my school and one of his former students returned to speak about his experience in the industry. He elaborated on projects
    he'd worked on, that thinking retrospectively he probably wasn't supposed to talk about. Nonetheless, I was fascinated. As if I wasn't sure of it already,
    I was now one hundred percent convinced that I wanted to study Computer Science. That leads us to now I am currently studying Computer Science at
    The University of Texas Rio Grande Valley. Upon graduation I hope I can work in a way that makes a positive and impactful difference in the world.
